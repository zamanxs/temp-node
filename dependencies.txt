** So, if we clone or any other person clones our repo or wants to simply use our code - they just need to go the package.json file and run the command 'npm install' in the terminal and all the dependencies will be installed.**

to intall any dev dependencies we use the command 'npm i nodemon -D' or we can use --save-dev instead of -D

In the script file we can customize our start commands or any other commands according to our needs and ease of usage.
nodemon automatically restarts our app always and we have to run the script commands of nodemon like - 'npm run <command name>'

we can simply uninstall using the uninstall command with npm or go with nuclear approach which is to manually delete the node_modules, removing the lock-json file and removing the dependency from the package.json file. And then run npm install in the terminal.
